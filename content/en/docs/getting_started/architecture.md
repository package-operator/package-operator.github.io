## Package Operator Manager
The main work of Package Operator is done by the Package Operator Manager. This component is run as a deployment
with a single replica. It contains the controllers for `(Cluster)Package`, `(Cluster)ObjectDeployment`, and
`(Cluster)ObjectSet` resources. It also contains a controller for `(Cluster)ObjectSetPhase` objects. This controller
reconciles `(Cluster)ObjectSetPhase`s with the `.spec.class` set to `default`.

Package Operator Manager also contains functionality to copy its own binary and load packages, which is discussed
in the [Loading Package Images Section](#loading-package-images), and functionality to allow Package Operator to
bootstrap itself, which is discussed on the [Installation Page](/docs/getting_started/installation#via_package_operator).

## Webhooks
There is a validation webhook server that can optionally be run with package operator. This webhook
server verifies the immutability of certain fields of `ObjectSet` and `ObjectSetPhase` resources.
If one of these immutable fields is changed in an update, the webhook server will disallow the update.

## Loading Package Images
A package is a single artifact that contains all manifests, configuration, and metadata needed to run an
application or operator. This single artifact takes the form of a non-runnable container image. This
image is supplied to Package Operator in a `(Cluster)Package` object.

When Package Operator reconciles a `(Cluster)Package` object, it needs to access the content of the package image.
Package Operator does this by deploying a separate Kubernetes Job. This Job has two containers, an init container
called `prepare-loader` and a regular container called `package-loader`.

The `prepare-loader` container uses the `package-operator-manager` image and copies the `package-operator-manager` binary to a shared
volume that both containers in the Job have access to. We have to do this because as mentioned before, the package
image is non-runnable, so we have to assume it has no shell or copy utilities to unpack the files it contains.

The `package-loader` container then uses the `package-operator-manager` binary to create an `ObjectDeployment`
that contains all the necessary information from the package image. The Job then finishes and is garbage collected.
