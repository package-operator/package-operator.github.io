The two possible values for `scopes` are `Cluster` and `Namespaced`.

`Cluster` scope allows the package to deploy cluster scoped object, such as CRDs. It also allows for deploying namespaced
resources in multiple namespaces.

`Namespaced` scope restricts the package to only installing namespaced resources, and only into the namespace that the
package is in.

Just one or both scopes can be specified for a single package.

The `scopes` given in the Package Manifest file determine which package resource can be used to deploy the package. If
only `Cluster` or only `Namespaced` is given as a scope, then the package must be deployed as a
[ClusterPackage](/docs/getting_started/api-reference.md#clusterpackage) or
[Package](/docs/getting_started/api-reference.md#package) respectfully. If both scopes are given, then the package can
be deployed as either resource.
