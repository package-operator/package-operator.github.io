```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
  state "Revision 1" as rev1
  state "Revision 2" as rev2
  state "Revision 3" as rev3
  [*] --> rev1
  rev1 --> rev2
  rev2 --> rev3
  rev3 --> [*]
```

Revisions are iterations and changes of a deployment over time. To support zero-downtime deployments, even if something goes wrong, Package Operator can manage multiple active revisions at the same time. This strategy is also often referred to as "A/B deployment" or "canary deployment".

A revision is represented by the `ObjectSet`/`ClusterObjectSet` APIs.

While revision are ordered on a time axis, Package Operator makes no assumptions on the contents of each revisions.
This means that Revision 3 could contain the same spec as Revision 1, rolling back changes introduced by Revision 2.

## Revision Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
  state "Not Ready" as not_ready
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> Available
  Available --> not_ready
  Pending --> not_ready
  not_ready --> Available
  Available --> Archived
  not_ready --> Archived
  Archived --> [*]
```

- **Pending**
  Intermediate state before the controller posted it's first update.
- **Available**
  All availability probes are successful.
- **Not Ready**
  One or more availability probes are unsuccessful.
- **Archived**
  (Cluster)ObjectSet is shutdown and only acts as a revision tombstone for rollbacks.

In addition to these major lifecycle states, (Cluster)ObjectSets may be **Paused**, stopping reconciliation, while still reporting status.
This can be useful for testing and debugging.

## Rollout Handling

Depending on the contents of the new revision, objects are eventually either:

- **Patched**
  If the object still part of the new revision, it will be handed over to the next revision.
- **Deleted**
  If the object is not part of the new revision, it will be deleted when the old revision is archived.

### In-Place Updates

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Revision 1
    deploy1["Deployment <b>my-deployment</b><br>image: my-image:rev1"]
  end
  subgraph Revision 2
    deploy2["Deployment <b>my-deployment</b><br>image: my-image:rev2"]
  end
  deploy1--patched object-->deploy2
```

"In-Place" updates happen when a new revision contains an object with the same name and type as the previous revision.
Objects are handed over to a new revision and patched as needed.

When all objects have been handed over to a new revision, the previous revision is automatically **archived**.

{{< alert text="Updating in-place may not provide any safety net.<br>If the Update fails, your deployment may face downtime." />}}

### A/B Updates

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Revision 1
    deploy1["Deployment <b>my-deployment-v1</b><br>image: my-image:rev1"]
  end
  subgraph Revision 2
    deploy2["Deployment <b>my-deployment-v2</b><br>image: my-image:rev2"]
  end
  deploy1-. indirect successor .->deploy2
```

A/B updates happen when a new revision does not contain an object with the same name and type as a previous revision.
A new object is created in the new revision without affecting the old object.

The old revision is only archived when the new revision has completely finished its rollout and is "Available".

### Intermediate (Failed) Revisions

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph rev1[Revision 1]
    cm1["ConfigMap <b>my-config</b><br>data: {key: value-v1}"]
    deploy1["Deployment <b>my-deployment-v1</b><br>image: my-image:rev1"]
  end
  subgraph rev2[Revision 2]
    cm2["ConfigMap <b>my-config</b><br>data: {key: value-v2}"]
    deploy2["Deployment <b>my-deployment-v2</b><br>image: my-image:does-not-exist"]
  end
  subgraph rev3[Revision 3]
    cm3["ConfigMap <b>my-config</b><br>data: {key: value-v3}"]
    deploy3["Deployment <b>my-deployment-v3</b><br>image: my-image:rev3"]
  end
  style rev2 fill:#ffbabd,stroke:#9f7b7d
  deploy1-->deploy2
  deploy2-->deploy3
  cm1-.->cm2
  cm2-.->cm3
```

Under normal circumstances at max 2 Revisions can be active during rollout. An old and a new revision.

If a revision fails to become available due to e.g. misconfiguration and a new revision supersedes it, multiple intermediate revisions might be active until the latest revision becomes available.

Intermediate revisions will only be cleaned up if:
- Latest revision becomes available
- Revision is not reconciling any objects anymore
- Latest revision is not containing any object still actively reconciled by an intermediate

{{< alert text="This behavior is necessary, so Package Operator can ensure the safe handover of objects between revisions." />}}

In the example above, the ConfigMap "my-config" is handed over from revision 1 to revision 2 and in the end to revision 3.

As soon as revision 3 takes ownership of the ConfigMap, the failed intermediate revision 2 can be archived, as "my-deployment-v2" no longer exists in revision 3 and is thus safe to delete.
